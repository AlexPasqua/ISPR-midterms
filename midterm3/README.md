## Midterm 3 - Assignment 1 (May 2021) - Autoencoders
#### Assignment request:
Train a denoising or a contractive autoencoder on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/):
try out different architectures for the autoencoder, including a single layer autoencoder,
a deep autoencoder with only  layerwise pretraining and a deep autoencoder with fine tuning.
It is up to you to decide how many neurons in each layer and how many layers you want in the deep autoencoder.
Show an accuracy comparison between the different configurations.
